download the h8figherassests if you are using novetus, else leave the decal alone. <br />
and change the http://www.roblox.com/asset/?id=imageid

the map is made in orrh
but the game is suppose to run on novetus
i fix this by making the versions 2 folders one for orrh and one for novetus
the novetus one is more likely to get updates
